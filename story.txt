One fall day, I found myself eating the most delicious Apfelkuchen.
One day I want to visit a Biergarten during Oktoberfest so I can try some new beers. 
While there, I would also like to try a Bratwurst!
Hopefully there will be a Rammstein playing while we are all eating and drinking.
I'll be sure to wear my best dirndel!
I have always wanted to try some authentic gebaeck from Germany, so this would be the best time.
I found a gorgeous nerby schloss to travel to and enjoy the day.
I saw a hund that was bigger than me enter the castle!
I decided to turn around to the Hauptstrasse instead of going into the schloss with the big hund.
Upon seeing the Beirgarten again, I felt a little wettbewerbsfaehig and wanted to see how much I could eat and drink.
After consuming an ungodly about of bratwurst followed by a gebaeck chaser, I could hardly walk down the Hauptstrasse.
